                 AUTO-DEFRAG Documentation

auto-defrag aims to defrag files in ext4 automatically, that means
users does not need to issue commands to do defrag.  Currently, there
is a tool called online-defrag can defrag files in ext4, online-defrag
need users to issue defrag manually.

To defrag a file, we need to reallocate blocks for the file and write
data of the file into new blocks and free orginal blocks.

Currently, auto-defrag is designed on top of ext4-snapshots and it works
as follows.  If a file A is rewritten and its goal blocks is taken by
snapshot files, then the blocks of the snapshot files are reallocated and
original blocks are freed and the blocks of the file A are reallocated as
well, and freed blocks are used.

There are 3 parts in auto-defrag implementation:
  -- trigger defrag on a file
     if goal blocks are taken by snapshot files, defrag on the file is
     triggered.

  -- async reads on snapshot files
     if goal blocks of a file are taken by snapshot files, async reads
     on snapshot files are issued.

  -- defrag a file
     if a defrag is triggered on a file, then we need to reallocate blocks
     for the file if possible.
