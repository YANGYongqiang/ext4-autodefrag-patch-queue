                 AUTO-DEFRAG Documentation

auto-defrag aims to defrag files in ext4 automatically, that means
users does not need to issue commands to do defrag.  Currently, there
is a tool called online-defrag can defrag files in ext4, online-defrag
need users to issue defrag manually.

To defrag a file, we need to reallocate blocks for the file and write
data of the file into new blocks and free orginal blocks.

For ext4, we can not know who takes goal blocks of a file, so we can
defrag the file only if the goal blocks are free.

For ext4-snapshots, we can know that if the goal blocks are taken by
snapshot files if the goal blocks are moved to snapshot.  Then we can
async read the goal blocks and reallocate blocks for them.

Currently, auto-defrag works as follows: if a file is rewritten and
goal blocks are free or taken by snapshot files, then the file will be
defragged.  If the goal blocks are free, then the goal blocks are added
to its preallocations.  If the goal blocks are taken by snapshot files,
auto-defrag reads the blocks and reallocates blocks for snapshot files.
In read call backs, reallocations are done for snapshot files, and orignal
blocks are added to the to-de-defragged file's preallocations.

There are 3 parts in auto-defrag implementation:
  -- trigger defrag on a file
     if goal blocks are either free or taken by snapshot files, defrag
     on the file is triggered.

  -- async reads on snapshot files and reallcoation
     if goal blocks of a file are taken by snapshot files, async reads
     on snapshot files are issued and auto-defrag reallocates blocks for
     snapshot files.

  -- defrag a file
     if a defrag is triggered on a file, then we need to reallocate blocks
     for the file if possible.
